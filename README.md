# goit-js-hw-07

This project was developed to deepen practical JavaScript skills by implementing dynamic functionality and interactive behavior within a static HTML context, as part of the GoIT Fullstack Developer curriculum.

Aligned with essential JavaScript and frontend development principles:

- JavaScript is used to manipulate DOM elements and implement interactive logic based on user actions.
- The project includes tasks that exercise DOM traversal, element creation, event handling, and UI response updates.
- Script files are organized within a `js/` directory to promote code modularity and separation of concerns.
- Standard coding conventions are applied to improve readability and maintainability, including descriptive naming and consistent formatting.
- The project focuses on vanilla JavaScript techniques without reliance on external libraries, fostering deeper understanding of core language features.
- The HTML structure is designed to provide a semantic foundation that supports the dynamic behaviors implemented via JavaScript.

This repository represents the seventh assignment in the GoIT JavaScript module and demonstrates practical application of scripting, DOM interaction, and event‑driven behavior in a client‑side environment.
